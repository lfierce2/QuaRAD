# QuaRA
The Quadrature-based model of Respiratory Aerosol (QuaRA) includes code for modeling the evolution and fate of plumes created during expiratory activities, utilizing optimized quadrature sampling to model the lognormal particulate distributions and their associated viral loads of airborne respiratory viruses throughout evaporation, convection, reflection, and deposition, including into another respiratory system. Outputs include particulate and virion concentrations throughout a simulated room for a single puff, as from a cough or a sneeze, or for approximately continuous emissions, as from breathing or speaking, and the associated probability of SARS-CoV-2 transmission between one infectious and one susceptible individual depending on their respective locations and length of encounter.
